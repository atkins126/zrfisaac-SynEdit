[//]: # (# - introduction)
## Introduction

This repository is a version of SynEdit that is specifically tailored to be compatible with older versions of Delphi. It is based on the Unicode version of SynEdit originally hosted at SourceForge. As maintaining the original project became increasingly challenging, Eric Grange decided to fork the project on GitHub, making it easier to manage through forking and merging.

For the original project and its readme.txt file, please refer to the following link: [SynEdit](https://github.com/SynEdit/SynEdit).

## Historical Note

SynEdit originated as an effort to continue the development of the mwEdit project, which was no longer maintained. The last public version of mwEdit (0.92a) can be found on the SynEdit website's download section.

mwEdit was initiated by Martin Waldenburg in 1998 with the goal of creating a syntax highlighting editor component for an open-source IDE. However, over the course of its 15 months of development, Martin became increasingly dissatisfied with the project's direction. Consequently, he requested the removal of his name and initials from the project. The project was subsequently renamed SynEdit and released as an open-source project under the MPL (Mozilla Public License). We express our gratitude to Martin Waldenburg for his initial efforts and acknowledge all the developers who contributed to the mwEdit project.
